# Project Atlas

Home improvement project management that actually works.

## About

Project Atlas is a purpose-built platform for managing home renovation projects. Built for homeowners who understand good tooling but are frustrated with existing home project management apps.

After years of trying generic kanban boards, overkill enterprise tools, and cutesy apps built by people who've clearly never spent a weekend installing subfloor, I decided to create something that treats home improvement like the complex, interconnected system it actually is.

## Features

- **Project Tracking** - Keep all your home projects organized in one place
- **Smart Planning** - Get help planning your renovation projects step by step  
- **Budget Control** - Track costs and stay within your renovation budget

## Development Status

ðŸš§ Currently in development

## Current Status

**Live Demo:** https://lab-foster.github.io/ProjectAtlas/

### What's Working
- Landing page with project overview
- Dashboard with realistic project tracking
- About page explaining the vision
- Contact form for feedback and beta interest

### In Development
- Full project management interface with epic/story/task hierarchies
- Six-stage kanban workflow (Someday/Maybe â†’ Research & Planning â†’ Permitted & Ready â†’ Active Work â†’ Waiting on External â†’ Done Done)
- Budget tracking with variance analysis and cost projections
- Calendar with contractor scheduling and permit deadline management
- Document management for photos, receipts, permits, and plans

## Core Philosophy

I'm borrowing workflow concepts from enterprise software development but mapping them to the reality of being your own PM, developer, QA tester, and budget holder. The platform understands that you can't tile the bathroom floor until the plumbing rough-in passes inspection, and it'll surface those blockers before you order materials.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5/CSS3 with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing or beta testing, please use the contact form on the site. I'm particularly looking for:

- Frontend developers with React/TypeScript experience
- UX designers who understand project management workflows
- Home renovation enthusiasts who can provide domain expertise
- Beta testers willing to try the platform on real projects

**License**

This project is currently in development and not yet open source. Planning to open source portions once the core architecture is stable.
