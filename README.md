# Project Atlas

Home improvement project management that actually works.

## About

Project Atlas is a purpose-built platform for managing home renovation projects. Built for homeowners who understand good tooling but are frustrated with existing home project management apps.

After years of trying generic kanban boards, overkill enterprise tools, and cutesy apps built by people who've clearly never spent a weekend installing subfloor, I decided to create something that treats home improvement like the complex, interconnected system it actually is.

## Features

- **Interactive Kanban Board** - Drag-and-drop task management with real-time updates
- **Project Tracking** - Keep all your home projects organized in one place with live status updates
- **Smart Planning** - Get help planning your renovation projects step by step  
- **Budget Control** - Track costs and stay within your renovation budget
- **Task Management** - Add, edit, delete, and organize tasks across projects
- **Persistent Storage** - All changes are saved locally using browser localStorage

## New in Version 1.5 - JavaScript Interactivity

### Kanban Board Features
- **Drag & Drop**: Move tasks between columns by dragging cards
- **Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by project and priority level
- **Add New Tasks**: Click "+ Add task" buttons to create new tasks in any column
- **Task Details**: Click any task card to view full details, edit, or delete
- **Status Notifications**: Visual feedback when tasks change status
- **Real-time Updates**: Task counts update automatically as you move cards

### Cross-Page Functionality
- **Dashboard Enhancements**: Click activity items for details
- **Projects Page**: Interactive task items with click handlers
- **Persistent Data**: All task changes sync across pages and persist in browser storage

### Technical Implementation
- Vanilla JavaScript (no dependencies)
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- Modal system for forms and details
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Mobile-responsive drag-and-drop
- Accessible keyboard navigation

## Development Status

- Advanced reporting and analytics

## Core Philosophy

I'm borrowing workflow concepts from enterprise software development but mapping them to the reality of being your own PM, developer, QA tester, and budget holder. The platform understands that you can't tile the bathroom floor until the plumbing rough-in passes inspection, and it'll surface those blockers before you order materials.

## Tech Stack

- HTML5/CSS3 with CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS custom properties for theming
- localStorage API for data persistence
- Drag and Drop API for Kanban functionality
- Mobile-first responsive design

## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing or beta testing, please use the contact form on the site. I'm particularly looking for:

- Frontend developers with React/TypeScript experience
- UX designers who understand project management workflows
- Home renovation enthusiasts who can provide domain expertise
- Beta testers willing to try the platform on real projects

**License**

This project is currently in development and not yet open source. Planning to open source portions once the core architecture is stable.
